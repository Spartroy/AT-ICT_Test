## CSS Enhancements

### 3D Transform Styles
```css
.flashcard-container {
  perspective: 1000px;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

.flashcard {
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  transition: transform 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}

.flashcard-front,
.flashcard-back {
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.flashcard-back {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}

.flashcard.flipped {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Flashcard Stacks
- `GET /api/flashcards` - Get all public flashcard stacks
- `POST /api/flashcards` - Create new flashcard stack
- `GET /api/flashcards/:id` - Get specific flashcard stack
- `PUT /api/flashcards/:id` - Update flashcard stack
- `DELETE /api/flashcards/:id` - Delete flashcard stack
- `GET /api/flashcards/my-stacks` - Get user's own stacks

### Individual Cards
- `POST /api/flashcards/:id/cards` - Add card to stack
- `PUT /api/flashcards/:id/cards/:cardIndex` - Update card
- `DELETE /api/flashcards/:id/cards/:cardIndex` - Remove card

### Study Tracking
- `POST /api/flashcards/:id/study` - Increment study count

## Usage Instructions

### For Teachers
1. Navigate to the "Flashcard Center" tab in the teacher dashboard
2. Click "Create Stack" to create a new flashcard stack
3. Fill in the stack details (title, subject, description)
4. Add cards with front (question) and back (answer) content
5. Set visibility (public/private)
6. Save the stack

### For Students
1. Navigate to the "Flashcards" tab in the student dashboard
2. Browse available flashcard stacks
3. Click "Study" to start studying a stack
4. Use the study mode with card flipping animations
5. Create your own stacks to share with others

### Study Mode Features
- **Card Flipping**: Click cards to flip between front and back
- **Navigation**: Use previous/next buttons to navigate cards
- **Study Mode**: Shuffle cards for randomized study sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Track study sessions and completion

## Testing

A test script has been created (`backend/scripts/testFlashcards.js`) to verify:
- Flashcard stack creation
- Card management operations
- Study tracking functionality
- Database queries and relationships

## Security Features

- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Users can only edit their own flashcard stacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and user feedback

## Performance Optimizations

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data on demand
- **Caching**: Efficient state management and updates
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Spaced Repetition**: Implement spaced repetition algorithms
- **Progress Analytics**: Detailed study progress tracking
- **Collaborative Stacks**: Allow multiple users to contribute to stacks
- **Media Support**: Support for images and audio in cards
- **Export/Import**: Allow users to export and import flashcard stacks
- **Study Reminders**: Scheduled study reminders and notifications

## Conclusion

The flashcard feature has been successfully implemented as a comprehensive learning tool that enhances the educational experience for both teachers and students. The feature includes modern UI design, smooth animations, and robust backend functionality, making it a valuable addition to the AT-ICT learning platform.
