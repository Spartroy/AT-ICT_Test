          question: "How do I know if AT-ICT is right for me?",
          answer: "AT-ICT is perfect for any IGCSE ICT student who wants to excel. Whether you're struggling with basics or aiming for an A*, our personalized approach adapts to your level. Try our free samples to experience our teaching style risk-free!"
        },
        {
          question: "What if I'm a complete beginner in ICT?",
          answer: "Perfect! Most of our A* students started as complete beginners. Our curriculum is designed to take you from zero knowledge to expert level. We start with fundamentals and gradually build your skills with patience and support."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I join mid-course if I'm already partway through my IGCSE year?",

          question: "How is this different from school ICT lessons?",
          answer: "Our focus is 100% on IGCSE exam success with interactive, practical learning. While school covers theory, we teach you how to think like an examiner, solve problems efficiently, and apply concepts in real scenarios. Plus, you get personal attention!"
        },
        {
          question: "Can I access materials after the course ends?",
          answer: "Yes! You get lifetime access to all course materials, including future updates. Many students continue using our resources even in university. Your success doesn't end with IGCSE!"

          question: "How quickly do you respond to questions?",
          answer: "Most questions are answered within 2-4 hours during weekdays, and within 8 hours on weekends. For urgent exam-related queries, we often respond within 30 minutes!"
        },

          question: "What if I don't achieve an A* grade?",
          answer: "While 95% of our students achieve A*/A grades, if you complete the course and don't reach your target grade, we'll provide additional support and resources at no extra cost until you do."

        },
        {
          question: "How much time should I dedicate per week?",
          answer: "We recommend 3-4 hours per week for optimal results. However, our flexible format allows you to study at your own pace. Some students do intensive weekend sessions, others prefer daily 30-minute chunks."
        },
        {
          question: "Is the course suitable for different exam boards?",
          answer: "Our course is specifically designed for Cambridge IGCSE ICT, but the concepts and skills transfer to other exam boards. We focus on understanding rather than memorization, making you exam-ready regardless of specific board requirements."
